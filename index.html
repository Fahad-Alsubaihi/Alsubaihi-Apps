<p>
Alsubaihi Apps respects your privacy and is committed to protecting user information. This Privacy Policy explains how our applications handle information.
</p>

<h3>1. Information Collection</h3>
<p>
Our applications do not collect, store, or share personal data such as names, emails, phone numbers, or location data unless explicitly stated within a specific application feature.
</p>

<h3>2. Permissions</h3>
<p>
If any application requests device permissions, they are used solely to enable core functionality (such as notifications or location-based prayer times) and are not used for tracking or advertising purposes.
</p>

<h3>3. Third-Party Services</h3>
<p>
Our applications may use trusted third-party services such as Google Play Services or Firebase (if applicable) for app stability, analytics, or crash reporting. These services operate under their own privacy policies.
</p>

<h3>4. Data Security</h3>
<p>
We take reasonable measures to ensure that applications are built securely and do not expose user data.
</p>

<h3>5. Children’s Privacy</h3>
<p>
Our applications are not directed toward children under 13 unless explicitly stated. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children.
</p>

<h3>6. Changes to This Policy</h3>
<p>
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page with an updated effective date.
</p>
